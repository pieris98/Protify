<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Protify is an open source platform designed to simplify and democratize workflows for chemical language models. With Protify, deep learning models can be trained to predict chemical properties at the click of a button, without requiring extensive coding knowledge or computational resources.

### Why Protify?

- **Benchmark multiple models efficiently**: Need to evaluate 10 different protein language models against 15 diverse datasets with publication-ready figures? Protify makes this possible without writing a single line of code.
- **Flexible for all skill levels**: Build custom pipelines with code or use our no-code interface depending on your needs and expertise.
- **Accessible computing**: No GPU? No problem. Synthyra offers precomputed embeddings for many popular datasets, which Protify can download for analysis with scikit-learn on your laptop.
- **Cost-effective solutions**: The upcoming Synthyra API integration will offer affordable GPU training options, while our Colab notebook provides an accessible entry point for GPU-reliant analysis.

Protify is currently in beta. We're actively working to enhance features and documentation to meet our ambitious goals.

## Usage

<details>
  <summary>Toggle </summary><br />
  
  To launch the gui, run
  
  ```bash
  python -m gui
  ```
  
  It's recommended to use the user interface alongside an open terminal, as helpful messages and progressbars will show in the terminal while you press the GUI buttons.
  
  ### An example workflow
  
  Here, we will compare various protein models against a random vector baseline (negative control) and random transformer (homology based control).
  
  1.) Start the session
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/1.PNG">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/2.PNG" width="500">
  
  2.) Select the models you would like to benchmark
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/3.PNG" width="500">
  
  3.) Select the datasets you are interested in. Here we chose Enzyme Commission numbers (multi-label classification), metal-ion binding (binary classification), solubility (binary classification), catalytic rate (kcat, regression), and protein localization (DeepLoc-2, binary classification).
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/4.PNG" width="500">
  
  4.) Embed the proteins in the selected datasets. If your machine does not have a GPU, you can download precomputed embeddings for many common sequences.
    Note: If you download embeddings, it will be faster to use the scikit model tab than the probe tab
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/5.PNG" width="500">
  
  5.) Select which probe and configuration you would like. Here, we will use a simple linear probe, a type neural network. It is the **fastest** (by a large margin) but worst performing option (by a small margin usually).
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/6.PNG" width="500">
  
  6.) Select your settings for training. Like most of the tabs, the defaults are pretty good. If you need information about what setting does what, the `?` button provides a helpful note. The documentations has more extensive information
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/7.PNG" width="500">
  
  This will train your models!
  
  7.) After training, you can render helpful visualizations by passing the log ID from before. If you forget it, you can look for the file generated in the `logs` folder.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/8.PNG" width="500">
  
  Here's a sample of the many plots produced. You can find them all inside `plots/your_log_id/*`
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/9.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/10.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/11.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/13.png" width="500">

  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/12.png" width="500">
  
  8.) Need to replicate your findings for a report or paper? Just input the generated log into the replay tab
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Gleghorn-Lab/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/14.PNG" width="500">

  To run the same session from the command line instead, you would simply execute
  ```
  python -m main --model_names ESM2-8 ESM2-35 ESMC-300 ProtBert ANKH-Base Random Random-Transformer --data_names EC DeepLoc-2 enzyme-kcat MB solubility --patience 3
  ```
  Or, set up a yaml file with your desired settings (so you don't have to type out everything in the CLI)
  ```
  python -m main --yaml_path yamls/your_custom_yaml_path.yaml
  ```
  Replaying from the CLI is just as simple
  ```
  python -m main --replay_path logs/your_log_id.txt
  ```

</details>

## Hyperparameter Optimization

Protify uses Weights & Biases (W&B) for automated hyperparameter optimization across all training modes (neural network probes, full fine-tuning, and hybrid probes). This feature allows you to systematically search for optimal hyperparameters to maximize model performance.

### Overview

- **Multiple search methods**: Choose from Bayesian, grid, or random search
- **Flexible configuration**: Customize which hyperparameters to optimize via the YAML file
- **Automatic best model selection**: After sweep completion, the best configuration is automatically applied and used for final training
- **Comprehensive logging**: All trials are logged to W&B and saved locally as CSV files for later analysis
- **Works with all training modes**: Neural network probes, full fine-tuning, and hybrid probes

### Quick Start

To use W&B hyperparameter optimization, simply add the `--use_wandb_hyperopt` flag to any run:

```bash
python -m main \
  --use_wandb_hyperopt \
  --model_names ESM2-8 ESM2-35 \
  --data_names DeepLoc-2 MB
```

That's it! The sweep will use default settings (Bayesian search, 10 trials, minimize validation loss). To customize these defaults, see the Configuration section below.

### Configuration
 
Hyperparameter sweeps are configured via the `sweep.yaml` file (located in `src/protify/yamls/sweep.yaml`), as well as the CLI. Here's the default configuration:

```yaml
early_terminate: {type: hyperband, min_iter: 10}  # early stopping (stops underperforming trials)

parameters:
  # Common parameters for all training modes
  lr:
    distribution: log_uniform_values
    min: 0.000001
    max: 0.01
  weight_decay:
    distribution: log_uniform_values
    min: 0.000001
    max: 0.1
  
  # Full finetuning specific parameters
  base_batch_size:
    values: [4, 8, 16]
  base_grad_accum:
    values: [4, 8, 16]
  
  # Probe specific parameters
  probe_batch_size:
    values: [16, 32, 64, 128]
  dropout:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.5
  hidden_size:
    values: [512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192]
  n_layers:
    values: [1, 2, 3]
  probe_pooling_types:
    values: ["cls", "mean"]
  
  # Transformer probe specific parameters
  transformer_dropout:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.5
  classifier_dropout:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.5
  pre_ln:
    values: [True, False]
  classifier_dim:
    values: [4096, 8192]
  n_heads:  # number of attention heads
    values: [2, 4, 8]
  
  # LoRA parameters
  lora_r:
    values: [8, 16, 32]
  lora_alpha:
    values: [16, 32, 64]
  lora_dropout:
    values: [0.0, 0.01, 0.05]
```    
### CLI Arguments

The following arguments control hyperparameter optimization:

- `--use_wandb_hyperopt`: Enable W&B hyperparameter optimization (flag)
- `--wandb_api_key`: Your Weights & Biases API key (alternatively set via environment variable, or the terminal when prompted)
- `--wandb_project`: W&B project name (default: "Protify")
- `--wandb_entity`: W&B team/user entity (optional)
- `--sweep_config_path`: Path to sweep configuration YAML (default: "yamls/sweep.yaml")
- `--sweep_count`: Number of trials to run (default: 10)
- `--sweep_method`: Search method - "bayes", "grid", or "random" (default: "bayes")
- `--sweep_metric_cls`: Classification metric to optimize during sweep (default: "test_loss")
- `--sweep_metric_reg`: Regression metric to optimize during sweep (default: "test_loss")
- `--sweep_goal`: Optimization goal - "maximize" or "minimize" (default: "minimize")

- **NOTE**: The default optimization strategy is to minimize the eval_loss. If you would like to choose a different metric via the `--sweep_metric_cls` and `--sweep_metric_reg` arguments, make sure you ALSO change `--sweep_goal` to **maximize**.

Common metrics you can optimize for:

- **Classification**: `test_accuracy`, `test_mcc`, `test_f1`, `test_precision`, `test_recall`
- **Regression**: `test_r_squared`, `test_pearson_rho`, `test_spearman_rho`

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Protify reads your sweep configuration and initializes a W&B sweep
2. **Trials**: For each trial, W&B suggests hyperparameters based on the search method
3. **Training**: A model is trained with the suggested hyperparameters
4. **Evaluation**: Validation metrics are computed and reported to W&B
5. **Selection**: After all trials, the best configuration is automatically selected
6. **Final training**: The model is retrained with the best hyperparameters and evaluated on the test set
7. **Results**: All results and plots are reported based on final test set performance. Top 5 W&B trials are saved to a CSV file (`logs/YOUR_ID_sweep_DATASET_MODEL.csv`) 
### ProteinGym Benchmarking

Protify includes a zero-shot pipeline for the ProteinGym DMS benchmark with a standardized performance summary.

- Run zero-shot scoring on ProteinGym substitutions
  ```console
  python -m main --proteingym \
    --model_names ESM2-8 ESM2-35 ProtBert \
    --dms_ids all \
    --scoring_method masked_marginal \
    --scoring_window optimal \
  ```
  - Outputs per-assay CSVs at `results/proteingym/*__zs_masked_marginal.csv`
  - After scoring, a standardized performance summary is written to `results/proteingym/benchmark_performance/`
    - This summary exactly matches the format expected by the ProteinGym repository for adding scores for a new model (ready to use in a PR)

  Available options
  - dms_ids. By default, all 217 substitution assays are used. You can specify DMS_ids by name to only use a subset.
  - scoring_method
    - masked_marginal (default): Mask mutated positions in the wild-type window; score Δlog p(mutant) − log p(wildtype) at those positions
    - wildtype_marginal: Unmasked wild-type context; score Δlog p(mutant) − log p(wildtype) at mutated positions
    - mutant_marginal: Unmasked mutant context; score Δlog p(mutant) − log p(wildtype) at mutated positions
    - pll: Pseudo log-likelihood obtained by masking each position and summing true-token log-likelihoods (indels are scored with a length-normalized PLL across windows)
    - global_log_prob: Unmasked log-probability of the entire mutated sequence/window
  - scoring_window
    - optimal (default): Single window (≤ model context) centered around the mutation barycenter
    - sliding: Non-overlapping contiguous windows across the full sequence (default for indels)

- Compare performance & time for each scoring method for one or more models
  ```console
  python -m main --proteingym --compare_scoring_methods \
    --model_names ESM2-650 \
    --dms_ids AACC1_PSEAI_Dandage_2018 A4_HUMAN_Seuma_2022 \
    --results_dir results
  ```
  - Saves a summary CSV to `results/scoring_methods_comparison.csv`
